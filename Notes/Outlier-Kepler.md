# Outlier Kepler Notes:

## Do's
1. Aim for a suitable indicated complexity, grade school / high school to junior college math level (depending on what is indicated in the task)â€”make it clear, challenging, and solvable.

2. Prioritize dimensions accurately and clearly identify and weigh critical factors such as Truthfulness and Instruction Following.

3. Maintain a balanced approach in detail, aiming for concise yet thorough explanations.

4. Base ratings strictly on evidenced reasoning, supported by specific examples drawn from the evaluated responses.

5. Stay consistent across your evaluation criteria, ratings, and decisions, ensuring fairness and coherence.

6. Thoroughly address all factual, logical, and instructional issues identified, correcting errors without introducing new ones.

7. Ensure rewritten responses explicitly adhere to all explicit and implicit prompt instructions.

8. Strive for fluency, clarity, and self-sufficiency; the rewrite must stand alone and be understandable without external context.

9. Conduct a final review before submission, ensuring enhanced readability, logical coherence, accuracy, and completeness.

10. Using AI tools (LLMs) to produce justifications.

11. Keep explanations concise, highlighting exact reasons for your decision aligned directly with the project's criteria and rating scale.


## Dont's
2. Do not treat all rating criteria equally; 
Truthfulness and Instruction Following should be treated as the most important dimensions.

3. Having contradictions between your dimensions and justifications
Ensure your ratings and justifications align logically, e.g., if you pick "No issues" then do not mention problems in the corresponding justificatiom


## Reasons Prompt are not good.

1. The problem has no solution

2. The problem has multiple correct solutions due to unclear constraints.
    - example a number divisible by 6 and between 20 and 40.

3. Open ended questions.
    - solve a hard calculus question for me

4. Simple questions.
    - calculate the volume of cube.
