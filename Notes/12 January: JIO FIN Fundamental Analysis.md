The intrinsic value of the stock is 168 (alphaspread) and presently the stock is trading at ~280.
Hence the stock is overvalued by ~40%.
But then again the stock is at its lowest right now i two months.
What is the likelihood of it dropping more.
I turned to TA for this. I checked that in the last two days the stock is bearish, and in general it bearish.
The last two candles are almost beairsh Marubuzo, and hence it would be a good thing to wait and see how the stock does in the next few sessions to determine the entry point.
