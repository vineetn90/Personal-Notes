# Investment Rationale Flow

## Flow 1:
1. The analyst would have an interface where they input all the stocks that the analyst would trade on.

2. Each stock would also have a buy/sell/increase/decrease entry corresponding to it.

3. The analyst presses a button once the input is made.

4. Once the button is pressed the reports are generated for each stock justifying the buy/sell/increase/decrease for each of them.

5. Each report gets automatically saved as a markdown with stock name and corresponding date as its identifier/name.

6. The analyst can edit the markdown for each stock and save it as a pdf or a markdown with a name of their choice.

## Flow 2:

1. At any given time the anaylyst can open the saved markdown file or the pdf for the corresponding stock.

2. If the opened file is markdown then the file can be edited and saved again (possibly) with a new name.
    - the edited markdown can also be saved as a pdf with a name of their choice.


## Hard Requirement
1. The data showed by the report corresponding to every stock should be correct.
