# ZK Products for Banks
Selling a zero-knowledge (ZK) product to banks requires identifying pain points in privacy, compliance, security, and efficiency where ZKPs offer a competitive edge. Here are a few interesting ideas:

1. Private Credit Scoring & Risk Assessment
ðŸ’¡ Problem: Banks need to assess a borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness without exposing sensitive financial data.
ðŸ”’ ZK Solution: A ZK-powered credit scoring system where customers can prove they meet lending criteria (e.g., income level, debt ratio) without revealing raw financial details.
ðŸ’° Why Banks Care: Improves compliance with data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA), expands lending to privacy-conscious customers, and reduces fraud risks.

2. ZK KYB (Know Your Business) & KYT (Know Your Transaction)
ðŸ’¡ Problem: Banks must comply with KYC/AML regulations but struggle with high compliance costs and data privacy concerns.
ðŸ”’ ZK Solution: Businesses and individuals can prove they meet regulatory requirements without exposing unnecessary information (e.g., proving a company is legally registered without revealing all its financials).
ðŸ’° Why Banks Care: Cuts onboarding friction, reduces regulatory risks, and allows faster, privacy-preserving due diligence.

3. Confidential Cross-Bank Transaction Settlement
ðŸ’¡ Problem: Banks donâ€™t want to reveal transaction details to competitors when settling cross-institution transfers.
ðŸ”’ ZK Solution: A ZK-based settlement protocol where banks can verify payments without exposing counterparties, amounts, or account balances to competitors.
ðŸ’° Why Banks Care: Increases privacy in interbank settlements, protects trade secrets, and reduces reliance on slow, expensive intermediaries.

4. Fraud-Proof Digital Asset Custody & Trading
ðŸ’¡ Problem: Banks entering the digital asset space must prove solvency while keeping customer balances confidential.
ðŸ”’ ZK Solution: A ZK-proof-of-reserves system where banks can cryptographically prove they hold enough assets to cover liabilities without disclosing exact balances.
ðŸ’° Why Banks Care: Builds trust with regulators and customers while ensuring privacy in digital asset custody.

5. ZK-Powered Secure Data Sharing for Credit Consortiums
ðŸ’¡ Problem: Banks want to share fraud data and risk signals across institutions without exposing customer data.
ðŸ”’ ZK Solution: A ZK-based consortium where banks can prove a customer has risky behavior (e.g., default history, fraud flags) without revealing personal details.
ðŸ’° Why Banks Care: Improves fraud detection and credit risk assessment while complying with strict data privacy laws.

Which One Stands Out?
The best choice depends on market demand, regulation, and feasibility. Private credit scoring and ZK KYB/KYT seem highly monetizable since they solve a clear compliance and privacy challenge. ZK settlements could be huge for large institutions handling cross-border payments.
