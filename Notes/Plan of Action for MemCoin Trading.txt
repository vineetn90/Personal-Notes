Plan of Action for MemCoin Trading:

1. all the launchpads from which memcoins are coing out
2. Taking the memcoin launchpads and indexing it with twitter announcements 
(frequency of mentions, starting proce, delta, rate at which wallets are added, rate at which the price is fluctuating,
how long this is lasting, if this coin was pumped for 10 hours then what were the indicators that showed this)
3. Indicators for dump (how many wallets are reducing, rate at which is reducing)
