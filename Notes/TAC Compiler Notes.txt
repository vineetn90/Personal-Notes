TAC Compiler Notes:

1. Writing code is easier for u becuase it is a subset of Rust.
2. We generate optimal tac's
3. The R1CS we generate has to be optimised. We did not work on optimising that.
4. We also have minimal error handling unlike circom where we have to generate the circuit to find the error. But we wanted to do a more detailed error handling but we did not continue it.
