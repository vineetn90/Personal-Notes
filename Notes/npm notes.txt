npm is the world's largest Software Registry.
The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.
Open-source developers use npm to share software.
Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

npm is free to use.
You can download all npm public software packages without any registration or logon.

npm includes a CLI (Command Line Client) that can be used to download and install software:
In Mac OS the command is: npm install <package>

npm is installed with Node.js
This means that you have to install Node.js to get npm installed on your computer.

The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js.
All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.
The content of package.json must be written in JSON.
At least two fields must be present in the definition file: name and version.


EXAMPLE of package.json
{
"name" : "foo",
"version" : "1.2.3",
"description" : "A package for fooing things",
"main" : "foo.js",
"keywords" : ["foo", "fool", "foolish"],
"author" : "John Doe",
"licence" : "ISC"
}


npm can manage dependencies.
npm can (in one command line) install all the dependencies of a project.
Dependencies are also defined in package.json.

If you want to share your own software in the npm registry, you can sign in at:
https://www.npmjs.com

You can publish any directory from your computer as long as the directory has a package.json file.
