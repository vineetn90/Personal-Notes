# Valuation lectures by V Damodaran

## Lecture 1.

1. Three broad themes that V Damodaran wants to establish:
    - Valuation is simple but we choose to make it complex
    - Valuation has a story, and valuation is more about the story than the numbers
    - valuation goes bad not because of the numbers but owing to
        - bias you come in, that is, preconceptions
        - unceratinity
        - complexity

2. What is something that you should not assume when you do intrinsic valuation?
    - think that they know something that you don't

3. What is the Bermuda triangle of valuation?
    - preconception on valuation
    - valuation is somehow science (this is wrong), because we use numbers. But remember this numbers are estimates
    - if you make the model bigger it going to get better (this is a misconception).

4. When you value a company be parsimonious, that is, if you can value a company with just three inputs then don't go looking for four. Less is more.

5. What are the three broad approaches to do valuation?
    - intrinsic valuation using fundamentals; cash flow is the most common toll used for estimated intrinsic value but its not the only one; the key here is that its all about the buisness
    - relative valuation; look at price of similar products in the market and use it to value the buisness.
    - applying option pricing model in the context of valuing these assets that have contingent cash flows.

**Note**: Among the three the first two are widely used.

6. What are contingent cash flows? 
    - It means that it has value only if something happens.
    - that is if you are a biotechnology company and you have a patent working through the pipeline, it will have value only if you get FDA approval.

**Note**: Underlying all the three valuation models are assumptions about how the markets work and better still how they don't work.

7. Each of these approaches make an assumption that the markets make mistakes, but all of them differ on how these mistakes are made and how they get corrected.

8. What is discounted cash flow analysis?
    - the value of an asset if the present value of the expected cash flow in the asset 
    - if you break down DCF then you will have three ingredients: cash flows, discount rate that reflects risk in those cash flows, life for the asset you are valuing (5 years, 10 years, or lifetime)
    - the assumption is that markets make an error in valuing individual companies and they correct these mistakes over time.  
    - hidden ingredient for DCF is long time horizon. (because markets might take a long time to correct its mistakes)

9. What is relative valuation?
    - valuation based on how similar assets are priced.
    - if you are going to relative valuation, you have given up on intrinsic valuation 
    - when you break down intrinsic valuation you see: scaled measure of price, need to find other investments that look like yours (this might be easy in some cases but difficult in case of companies), control for differences.
    - the assumption is that the markets are right on average but they are wrong on individual companies, and the mistakes on the indivdual companies will get corrected sooner rather than later

**Note**: 
- scaled measure of price implies you take ratios (eg. price to earnings) and this enables one to compare these quantities for companies irrespective of scale.
- An investor performing relative valuation defines what a similar company is and then controls for differences.

10. How does one use option pricing in the context of valuation?
    - Options derive their value from an underlying asset, they have a contingent payoff, and they have a limited life.
