# Stack Building Plan

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Architecture Planning (1–2 months)
Tasks:
1. Research decentralized technologies (IPFS, Bittensor, Eigenlayer, NEAR).
2. Define overall architecture: how decentralized data, computation, and smart contracts will work together.
3. Choose development frameworks and tech stack (e.g., React for frontend, web3.js or ethers.js for blockchain interactions).
4. Set up development environments (e.g., testnets, smart contract frameworks like Truffle/Hardhat, decentralized storage solutions).

## Phase 2: Core Development - Web 3 Integration (3–5 months)
Tasks:
1.  Web 3 Integration: Integrate decentralized storage solutions (IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave) to manage datasets and models.
2. Implement smart contract development (Solidity or Rust for NEAR/Ethereum) for data access, computation rewards, and model versioning.
3. Integrate Web 3 wallets (e.g., Metamask) for user authentication and smart contract interaction.
4. Data Management: Write code for decentralized dataset storage (upload/fetch from IPFS).
5. Set up decentralized compute interfaces (e.g., integrating Bittensor for ML tasks).
6. Basic Front-End Development: Build a front-end for user interaction with datasets, training models, and checking rewards. Use React or Next.js with Web 3 libraries (web3.js, ethers.js).

## Phase 3: Machine Learning Pipeline Integration and Tokenomics (2–3 months)
Tasks:
1. Feature Engineering and Model Training: Implement decentralized feature engineering workflows.
2. Set up decentralized ML training via Bittensor or Eigenlayer. Hyperparameter Search: Integrate decentralized hyperparameter search functionality.
3. Use blockchain to track and incentivize contributors to the ML training process.
4. Tokenomics & Rewards System: Develop and deploy smart contracts for tokenomics (rewards, governance). Set up a reward system for data and compute contributions using ERC-20 or other token standards.

## Phase 4: Front-End and User Experience Refinement (2–3 months)
Tasks:
1. Front-End Development: Continue developing the user interface and connecting it with the back-end Web 3 infrastructure (using React, Next.js, web3.js).
2. Implement the full user flow for dataset management, model training, and reward withdrawal.
3. UX/UI Design: Refine user interfaces to be user-friendly and intuitive. Ensure a smooth Web 3 experience (wallet integration, transaction management).
4. Testing and Bug Fixes:
Begin rigorous testing of the platform, especially Web 3-specific functions (smart contract interactions, decentralized file retrieval, etc.).


## Phase 5: Testing and Final Deployments (1–2 months)
Tasks:
1. Testnet and Beta Testing: Conduct thorough testing on a testnet (e.g., Ethereum’s Rinkeby or Goerli) to test smart contracts and interactions in a live, decentralized environment.
Engage beta testers to evaluate the platform’s performance, ease of use, and potential issues.
2. Security Audits: Have security audits done for smart contracts and the platform to ensure it is safe to handle real transactions and sensitive data.
3. Launch Prep: Prepare for a mainnet launch (e.g., deploying smart contracts on Ethereum or NEAR).
4. Set up decentralized storage and compute resources for full production use.
