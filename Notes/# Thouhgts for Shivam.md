1. What is a validity proof system

2. ZK as a consequence

3. How are ZK proof systems structured: PIOP (Information Theoretic) + PCS (Cryptographic)

4. What are zkVMs?

5. What are famous PIOP's?

6. What are famous PCS schemes?

7. Why are there so many PIOP schemes?
    - motivation behind so many PCS

8. Why are there so many PCS schemes?
    - hash vs curve?
    - transparent vs structured srs

9. Overview of what we have built. 
    - Different PIOPs we have built: STARK, and PLONK, Lasso, Spartan, Jolt,
    - All PCS schemes we have built 
    - Jolt for RISC V, Jolt for Arithmic
    - Jolt for a16z
    - Streaming Jolt
